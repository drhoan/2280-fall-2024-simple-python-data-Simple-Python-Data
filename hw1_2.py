# Many people keep time using a 24 hour clock (11 is 11am and 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight).
# If it is currently 13 and you set your alarm to go off in 50 hours (lapse time), it will go off at 15.
# Write a Python program that asks user for the current time and the lapse time
# The program then print the go off time given the current time and the lapse time.
# Example user enters current time 13, lapse time 2 -> program print out go off time 15
# Example user enters current time 13, lapse time 50 -> program also print out go off time 15

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get the current time from the user

    # Get the lapse time from the user

    # Calculate and print the go off time
