# It is possible to name the days 0 through 6 where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday.
# If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights
# you would return home on day 6 (Saturday).
# Write a general version of the program that asks user for the leaving day and holiday length
# The program will calculate and print out the return day given the leaving day and the holiday length.
# Example: leaving day 3, holiday length 10 -> return day 6

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Get the leaving day from the user

    # Get the holiday length from the user

    # Calculate and print the return day
